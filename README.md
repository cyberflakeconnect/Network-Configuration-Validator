# Network-Configuration-Validator
Creating a shell script to check and validate network configurations involves several steps, such as verifying network interfaces, IP addresses, subnet masks, gateway settings, DNS configurations, and ensuring compliance with standards and best practices.

This script will generate a network configuration review report that includes details about network interfaces, IP addresses, subnet masks, default gateway, and DNS configuration. It also performs basic compliance checks to ensure that all interfaces have IP addresses and that DNS is configured. The report will be saved to network_config_review.txt in the same directory as the script. You can expand the compliance checks based on your specific standards and best practices.
